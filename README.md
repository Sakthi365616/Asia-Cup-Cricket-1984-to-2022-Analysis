Asia Cup Cricket (1984 to 2022) Analysis from different perspective

## Description:
+ Welcome to my latest data science project on the Asia Cup Cricket from 1984 to 2022. Using Python programming, I meticulously cleaned the data by managing null values, duplicates, outliers, and other factors. I also created several sub-Data Frames to analyze different parameters and used interactive visualizations to provide deeper insights.

+ Through my analysis, I was able to identify team performances based on several factors such as Toss winning and Ground. Furthermore, I also identified the top 10 highest scores, the Man of the Match winners, and various other parameters that will provide invaluable insights to cricket fans.

+ Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Asia Cup Cricket, and I am excited to share my findings with others. The interactive visualizations and sub-Data Frames make it easy for anyone to understand and explore the data in greater depth.
